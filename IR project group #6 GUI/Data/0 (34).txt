These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my
undertaking with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale
with study, and my person had become emaciated with
confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed;
yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour
might realise. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to
which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight
labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued
nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive the horrors of my
secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave
or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay? My limbs
now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a
resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed
to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was
indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed
acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I
had returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnelhouses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets
of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top
of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a
gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my
eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details
of my employment. The dissecting room and the slaughter-house
furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature
turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an
eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to
a conclusion.
The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and
soul, in one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the
fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more
luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of
nature. And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes
around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so
many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I
knew my silence disquieted them, and I well remembered the
words of my father: “I know that while you are pleased with
yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear
regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any
interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other
duties are equally neglected.”
I knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I
could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in
itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I
wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of
affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of
my nature, should be completed.
I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my
neglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced
that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether
free from blame. A human being in perfection ought always to
