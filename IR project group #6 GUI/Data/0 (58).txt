support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and
perdition. What could I do? In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie;
and now only am I truly miserable.”
She paused, weeping, and then continued, “I thought with
horror, my sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom
your blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved,
was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself
could have perpetrated. Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon
shall see you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and
that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death.”
“Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted
you. Why did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not
fear. I will proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the
stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall
not die! You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on
the scaffold! No! No! I never could survive so horrible a
misfortune.”
Justine shook her head mournfully. “I do not fear to die,” she
said; “that pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me
courage to endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if
you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I
am resigned to the fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to
submit in patience to the will of heaven!”
During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison
room, where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.

felt not, as I did, such deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth
and ground them together, uttering a groan that came from my
inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw who it was, she
approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very kind to visit me;
you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?”
I could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more
convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard
that you had confessed, he did not credit it.”
“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest
gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet
is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more
than half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now
that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your
cousin.”
Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She
indeed gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer,
felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no
hope or consolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but
hers also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that
passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its
brightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my
heart; I bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish. We
