My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was
during sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often,
when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me
even to rapture. The spirits that guarded me had provided these
moments, or rather hours, of happiness that I might retain strength
to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite, I should have
sunk under my hardships. During the day I was sustained and
inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my
wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent
countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s
voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when
wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was
dreaming until night should come and that I should then enjoy
reality in the arms of my dearest friends. What agonising fondness
did I feel for them! How did I cling to their dear forms, as
sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade
myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that
burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards
the destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as
the mechanical impulse of some power of which I was
unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul.
What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know.
Sometimes, indeed, he left marks in writing on the barks of the
trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated my fury. “My
reign is not yet over”—these words were legible in one of these
inscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I
seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the
misery of cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find
near this place, if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be
refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our
lives, but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until
that period shall arrive.”
Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote
thee, miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my
search until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join
my Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for
me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!
As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows
thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to
support. The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few
of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom
starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey. The
rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be procured; and
thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.
The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my
labours. One inscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare!
Your toils only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for
we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will
satisfy my everlasting hatred.”
My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these
