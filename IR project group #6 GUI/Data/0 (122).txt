Chapter 21
I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old
benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me,
however, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards
my conductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses on this
occasion.
About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected
by the magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night
before with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when,
about ten o’clock, they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and
they accordingly put in for port. It was a very dark night, as the
moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as
they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below. He
walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his
companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding
along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his
length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and
by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the
body of a man, who was to all appearance dead. Their first
supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had
been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on
examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that
the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage
of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to
restore it to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about
five and twenty years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for
there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers
on his neck.
The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me,
but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the
murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs
trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean
on a chair for support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye
and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.
The son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent
was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his
companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short
distance from the shore; and as far as he could judge by the light of
a few stars, it was the same boat in which I had just landed.
A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was
standing at the door of her cottage, waiting for the return of the
fishermen, about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the
body, when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from
that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found.
Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having
brought the body into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a
bed and rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary,
but life was quite gone.
