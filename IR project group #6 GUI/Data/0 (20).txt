Chapter 2
We were brought up together; there was not quite a year
difference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any
species of disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our
companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our
characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and
more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was
capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten
with the thirst for knowledge. She busied herself with following
the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous
scenes which surrounded our Swiss home —the sublime shapes of
the mountains, the changes of the seasons, tempest and calm, the
silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine
summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.
While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied
spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in
investigating their causes. The world was to me a secret which I
desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden
laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to
me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember.
On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my
parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves
in their native country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a
campagne on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance

attach myself fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my
school-fellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the
closest friendship to one among them. Henry Clerval was the son
of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and
fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own
sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He
composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of
enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays
and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn
from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King
Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the
holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.
No human being could have passed a happier childhood than
myself. My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness
and indulgence. We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our
lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the
many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other
families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was,
and gratitude assisted the development of filial love.
My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement;
but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards
