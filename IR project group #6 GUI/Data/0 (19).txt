that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents’ house—
my more than sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all
my occupations and my pleasures.
Everyone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential
attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it,
my pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being
brought to my home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a
pretty present for my Victor—tomorrow he shall have it.” And
when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her
promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words
literally and looked upon Elizabeth as mine—mine to protect, love,
and cherish. All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a
possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the
name of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind
of relation in which she stood to me—my more than sister, since
till death she was to be mine only.
