was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the
fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations
were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own
inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my
instructors. And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded
systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory
theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of
multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and
childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my
ideas.
When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house
near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible
thunderstorm. It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and
the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various
quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted,
watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the
door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and
beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and
so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared,
and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the
next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It
was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin
ribbons of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.
Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws
of electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural
philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered
on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject
of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and
astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade
Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of
my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men
disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me
as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that had so long
engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable. By one of those
caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early
youth, I at once gave up my former occupations, set down natural
history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and
entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could
never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In this
mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches
of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure
foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.
Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight
ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it
seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and
will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life
â€”the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the
storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop
me. Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and
gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient
