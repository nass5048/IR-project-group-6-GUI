visits were short and with long intervals.
One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a
chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I
was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had
better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was
replete with wretchedness. At one time I considered whether I
should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law,
less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my thoughts
when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin
entered. His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he
drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in French,
“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything
to make you more comfortable?”
“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the
whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”
“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief
to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you
will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless
evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal
charge.”
“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events,
become the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I
am and have been, can death be any evil to me?”
“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than
the strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by
some surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its
hospitality, seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first
sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend,
murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by
some fiend across your path.”
As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured
on this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise
at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose
some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr.
Kirwin hastened to say,
“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were
on your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might
discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an
account of your misfortune and illness. I found several letters, and,
among others, one which I discovered from its commencement to
be from your father. I instantly wrote to Geneva; nearly two
months have elapsed since the departure of my letter. But you are
ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any kind.”
“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible
event; tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose
murder I am now to lament?”
“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with gentleness;
“and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”
I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself,
