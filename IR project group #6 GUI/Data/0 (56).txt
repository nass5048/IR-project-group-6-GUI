unwilling to come forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource,
her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail
the accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired
permission to address the court.
“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who was
murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived
with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may
therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this
occasion, but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through
the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to
speak, that I may say what I know of her character. I am well
acquainted with the accused. I have lived in the same house with
her, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years. During
all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent
of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in
her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards
attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that
excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again
lived in my uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family.
She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted
towards him like a most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do
not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the evidence produced
against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had no
temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the chief
proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly
given it to her, so much do I esteem and value her.”
A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and
powerful appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference,
and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation
was turned with renewed violence, charging her with the blackest
ingratitude. She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not
answer. My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the
whole trial. I believed in her innocence; I knew it. Could the
dæmon who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my
brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death
and ignominy? I could not sustain the horror of my situation, and
when I perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of
the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed
out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did not equal
mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse
tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.
I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I
went to the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask
the fatal question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the
cause of my visit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all
black, and Justine was condemned.
I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before
experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to
bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey
an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The
