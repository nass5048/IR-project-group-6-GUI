entered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had remained there
or passed through; at any rate I had no means of extracting it. My
sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the
injustice and ingratitude of their infliction. My daily vows rose for
revenge—a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone
compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.
“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my
journey. The labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by
the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a
mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more
painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure.
“But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from
this time I reached the environs of Geneva.
“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place
among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I
should apply to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far
too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect
of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.
“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of
reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful
child, who came running into the recess I had chosen, with all the
sportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea
seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived
too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. If,
therefore, I could seize him and educate him as my companion and
friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth.
“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and
drew him towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed
his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his
hand forcibly from his face and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning
of this? I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.’
“He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried; ‘monster! Ugly
wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You are an ogre.
Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’
“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with
me.’
“‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M.
Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.’
“‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards
whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’
“The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which
carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and
in a moment he lay dead at my feet.
“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and
hellish triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create
desolation; my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry
despair to him, and a thousand other miseries shall torment and
destroy him.’
