in agony, I exclaimed, “Oh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all
about to mock me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and
memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart, and
leave me in darkness.”
These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe
to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and
how I listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc
on its way to consume me.
Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I
took no rest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own
heart I could give no expression to my sensations—they weighed
on me with a mountain’s weight and their excess destroyed my
agony beneath them. Thus I returned home, and entering the house,
presented myself to the family. My haggard and wild appearance
awoke intense alarm, but I answered no question, scarcely did I
speak. I felt as if I were placed under a ban—as if I had no right to
claim their sympathies—as if never more might I enjoy
companionship with them. Yet even thus I loved them to adoration;
and to save them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most
abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation made every
other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream, and
that thought only had to me the reality of life.
