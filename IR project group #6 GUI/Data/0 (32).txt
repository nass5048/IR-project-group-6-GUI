are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or
carelessness did not restrain our inquiries. I revolved these
circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply
myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy
which relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an
almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would
have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the causes
of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became acquainted
with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also
observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my
education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my
mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not
ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have
feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my
fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies
deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength,
had become food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the
cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and
nights in vaults and charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon
every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human
feelings. I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and
wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming
cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye
and brain. I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of
causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and
death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light
broke in upon meâ€”a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so
simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the
prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many
men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same
science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a
secret.
Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun
does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now
affirm is true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages
of the discovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights
of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the
cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable
of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.
The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this
discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much
time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my
desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this
discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by
which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I
beheld only the result. What had been the study and desire of the
wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my
grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once:
the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my
endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of
my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was
