with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.
I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections
during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At
length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted
and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening
as I pleased.
The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid
a visit to some of the principal professors. Chance—or rather the
evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted
omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant
steps from my father’s door—led me first to M. Krempe, professor
of natural philosophy. He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued
in the secrets of his science. He asked me several questions
concerning my progress in the different branches of science
appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and partly
in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the
principal authors I had studied. The professor stared. “Have you,”
he said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”
I replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M.
Krempe with warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those
books is utterly and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory
with exploded systems and useless names. Good God! In what
desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to
inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed
are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient? I little
expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of
Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear sir, you must begin your
studies entirely anew.”
So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several
books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to
procure, and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning
of the following week he intended to commence a course of
lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that
M. Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the
alternate days that he omitted.
I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long
considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated;
but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies
in any shape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice
and a repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not
prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. In rather a too
philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an
account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my
early years. As a child I had not been content with the results
promised by the modern professors of natural science. With a
confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth
and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of
knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries
of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists. Besides,
I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was
