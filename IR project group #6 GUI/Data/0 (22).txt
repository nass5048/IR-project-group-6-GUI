If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to
explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely
exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced
which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the
powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former
were real and practical, under such circumstances I should
certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my
imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to
my former studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas
would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.
But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no
means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I
continued to read with the greatest avidity.
When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole
works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus
Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with
delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few besides
myself. I have described myself as always having been imbued
with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of
the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern
philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and
unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt
like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored
ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of natural
philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my
boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.
The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was
acquainted with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher
knew little more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but
her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He
might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a
final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were
utterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and
impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the
citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined.
But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated
deeper and knew more. I took their word for all that they averred,
and I became their disciple. It may appear strange that such should
arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of
education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, selftaught with regard to my favourite studies. My father was not
scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child’s blindness, added
to a student’s thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my new
preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of
the philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon
obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an inferior object, but
what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease
from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a
violent death!
Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils
