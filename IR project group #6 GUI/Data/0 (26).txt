with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one
remains whom the spoiler has not seized.
My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these
events, was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father
a respite of some weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to
leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning and to
rush into the thick of life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the
less alarm me. I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that
remained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth
in some degree consoled.
She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us
all. She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage
and zeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught
to call her uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at
this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent
them upon us. She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to
make us forget.
The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last
evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to
permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student,
but in vain. His father was a narrow-minded trader and saw
idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry
deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal
education. He said little, but when he spoke I read in his kindling
eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to
be chained to the miserable details of commerce.
We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other
nor persuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said, and
we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that
the other was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended
to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there
—my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once
more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often
and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and
friend.
I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and
indulged in the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been
surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in
endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure—I was now alone. In the
university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be
my own protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded
and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new
countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these
were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself totally unfitted for
the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I
commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes
rose. I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often,
when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped
up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my
station among other human beings. Now my desires were complied
