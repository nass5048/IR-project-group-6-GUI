Chapter 7
On my return, I found the following letter from my father:—
“My dear Victor,
“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date
of your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few
lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you.
But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What
would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and
glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?
And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have
rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict
pain on my long absent son? I wish to prepare you for the woeful
news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over
the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible
tidings.
“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and
warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is

for a long time, but that he did not return.
“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for
him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have
returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with
torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had
lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;
Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning
I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen
blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and
motionless; the print of the murder’s finger was on his neck.
“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my
countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest
to see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she
persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the
neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I
have murdered my darling child!’
“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When
