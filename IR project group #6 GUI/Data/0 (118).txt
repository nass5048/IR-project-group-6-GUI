see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a dæmon
whom I had myself created.
I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all
it loved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and
the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered
by a deep sleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding
night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching
and misery. The sleep into which I now sank refreshed me; and
when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human
beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed
with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rang in my
ears like a death-knell; they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and
oppressive as a reality.
The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying
my appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake,
when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men
brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and one
from Clerval entreating me to join him. He said that he was
wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was, that letters from
the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete
the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise. He
could not any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to
London might be followed, even sooner than he now conjectured,
by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of my
society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to
leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might
proceed southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to
life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two
days.
Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I
shuddered to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and
for that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of
my odious work, and I must handle those utensils the sight of
which was sickening to me. The next morning, at daybreak, I
summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my
laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had
destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had
mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect
myself and then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I
conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I
ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and
suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket,
with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to
throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat
upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical
apparatus.
Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had
taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the
dæmon. I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair
as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but
