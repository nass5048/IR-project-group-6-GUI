Chapter 8
We passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial
was to commence. My father and the rest of the family being
obliged to attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court.
During the whole of this wretched mockery of justice I suffered
living torture. It was to be decided whether the result of my
curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my
fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy, the
other far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of
infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror. Justine
also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to
render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an
ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would
I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but
I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would
have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not
have exculpated her who suffered through me.
The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in
mourning, and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered,
by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she
appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble, although
gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kindness which
her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the
minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was
supposed to have committed. She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity
was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been
adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an
appearance of courage. When she entered the court she threw her
eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated. A tear
seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered
herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter
guiltlessness.
The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the
charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts
combined against her, which might have staggered anyone who
had not such proof of her innocence as I had. She had been out the
whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and
towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far
from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been
afterwards found. The woman asked her what she did there, but
she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and
unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight
o’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night,
she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded
earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him. When shown
the body, she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several
days. The picture was then produced which the servant had found
in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that
