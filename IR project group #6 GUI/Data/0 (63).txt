boyhood. Six years had passed since then: I was a wreck, but
nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.
I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I
afterwards hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to
receive injury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was
about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months after
the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all
my woe. The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I
plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains
and precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the
river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls
around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence—and I ceased to
fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had
created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most terrific
guise. Still, as I ascended higher, the valley assumed a more
magnificent and astonishing character. Ruined castles hanging on
the precipices of piny mountains, the impetuous Arve, and cottages
every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a
scene of singular beauty. But it was augmented and rendered
sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids
and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the
habitations of another race of beings.
I passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river
forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that
overhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This
valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and
picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The
high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I
saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers
approached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling
avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the
supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the
surrounding aiguilles, and its tremendous dôme overlooked the
valley.
A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me
during this journey. Some turn in the road, some new object
suddenly perceived and recognised, reminded me of days gone by,
and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The
very winds whispered in soothing accents, and maternal Nature
bade me weep no more. Then again the kindly influence ceased to
act—I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the
misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to
forget the world, my fears, and more than all, myself—or, in a
more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on the grass,
weighed down by horror and despair.
At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion
succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I
had endured. For a short space of time I remained at the window
watching the pallid lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and
listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its noisy way
