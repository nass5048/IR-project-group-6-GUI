Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”
“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is
not this a free country?”
“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a
magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a
gentleman who was found murdered here last night.”
This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was
innocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my
conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the
town. I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being
surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength,
that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or
conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a
few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and
despair all fear of ignominy or death.
I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the
memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in
proper detail, to my recollection.
