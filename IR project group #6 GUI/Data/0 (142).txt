concluded, and rage choked my utterance.
I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and
fiendish laugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains
re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery
and laughter. Surely in that moment I should have been possessed
by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my
vow was heard and that I was reserved for vengeance. The laughter
died away, when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparently
close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper, “I am
satisfied, miserable wretch! You have determined to live, and I am
satisfied.”
I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but
the devil eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon
arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled
with more than mortal speed.
I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task.
Guided by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but
vainly. The blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance,
I saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound
for the Black Sea. I took my passage in the same ship, but he
escaped, I know not how.
Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded
me, I have ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants,
scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path;
sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him I
should despair and die, left some mark to guide me. The snows
descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the
white plain. To you first entering on life, to whom care is new and
agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still
feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the least pains which I was
destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil and carried about
with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and
directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly
extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.
Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the
exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored
and inspirited me. The fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the
peasants of the country ate, but I will not doubt that it was set there
by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry,
the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud
would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and
vanish.
I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the
dæmon generally avoided these, as it was here that the population
of the country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were
seldom seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that
crossed my path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of
the villagers by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that
I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always presented to
those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.
