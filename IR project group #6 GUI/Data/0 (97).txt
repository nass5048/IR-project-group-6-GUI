me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered
wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me no
respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could
not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I
arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered
its warmth and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in
an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.
“I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was
secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however,
finding that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to
continue my journey after the sun had risen; the day, which was
one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the loveliness of its
sunshine and the balminess of the air. I felt emotions of gentleness
and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me. Half
surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be
borne away by them, and forgetting my solitude and deformity,
dared to be happy. Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even
raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun,
which bestowed such joy upon me.
“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came
to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into
which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the
fresh spring. Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to
pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to
conceal myself under the shade of a cypress. I was scarcely hid
when a young girl came running towards the spot where I was
concealed, laughing, as if she ran from someone in sport. She
continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when
suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rapid stream. I
rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour, from the
force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She was
senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to
restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the
approach of a rustic, who was probably the person from whom she
had playfully fled. On seeing me, he darted towards me, and
tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of
the wood. I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the
man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my
body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my injurer, with increased
swiftness, escaped into the wood.
“This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a
human being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed
under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and
bone. The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had
entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage
and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred
and vengeance to all mankind. But the agony of my wound
overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.
“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods,
endeavouring to cure the wound which I had received. The ball had
