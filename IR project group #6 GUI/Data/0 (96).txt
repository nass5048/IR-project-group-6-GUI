“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and
quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the
blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of
insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection.
I lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the
devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the
edge of which the moon nearly touched. A part of its orb was at
length hid, and I waved my brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I
fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had collected. The
wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the
flames, which clung to it and licked it with their forked and
destroying tongues.
“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any
part of the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in
the woods.
“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my
steps? I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to
me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible. At
length the thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your
papers that you were my father, my creator; and to whom could I

succour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of
hatred. Unfeeling, heartless creator! You had endowed me with
perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the
scorn and horror of mankind. But on you only had I any claim for
pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice
which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore
the human form.
“My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It
was late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long
resided. I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage
of a human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became
heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were
frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I
found no shelter. Oh, earth! How often did I imprecate curses on
the cause of my being! The mildness of my nature had fled, and all
within me was turned to gall and bitterness. The nearer I
approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit
