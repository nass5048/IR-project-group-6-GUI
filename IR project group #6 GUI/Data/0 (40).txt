“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good you
are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as
you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How
shall I ever repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the
disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will
forgive me.”
“You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself,
but get well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good
spirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I not?”
I trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an
object on whom I dared not even think?
“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of
colour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father and
cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in
your own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been
and are uneasy at your long silence.”
“Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my
first thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I
love and who are so deserving of my love?”
“If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be
glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is
from your cousin, I believe.”
