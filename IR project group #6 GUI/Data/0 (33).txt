like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a
passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly
ineffectual light.
I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your
eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the
secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently
until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am
reserved upon that subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and
ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible misery.
Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how
dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier
that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he
who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.
When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I
hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should
employ it. Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing
animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its
intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of
inconceivable difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I
should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of
simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by
my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to
an animal as complex and wonderful as man. The materials at
present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so
arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should ultimately
succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my
operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be
imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every
day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to
hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of
future success. Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity
of my plan as any argument of its impracticability. It was with
these feelings that I began the creation of a human being. As the
minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I
resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a
gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and
proportionably large. After having formed this determination and
having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging
my materials, I began.
No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me
onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life
and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break
through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new
species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and
excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could
claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve
theirs. Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow
animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although
I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently
devoted the body to corruption.
