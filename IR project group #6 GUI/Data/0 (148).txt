visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,
never, never again to rise.”
Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a
friend; I have sought one who would sympathise with and love me.
Behold, on these desert seas I have found such a one, but I fear I
have gained him only to know his value and lose him. I would
reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.
“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards
so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh
affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can
any man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another
Elizabeth? Even where the affections are not strongly moved by
any superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always
possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later
friend can obtain. They know our infantine dispositions, which,
however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated;
and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as
to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a brother can never,
unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early, suspect the
other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however
strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be
contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only
through habit and association, but from their own merits; and
wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the
conversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are
dead, and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to
preserve my life. If I were engaged in any high undertaking or
design, fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures, then
could I live to fulfil it. But such is not my destiny; I must pursue
and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on
earth will be fulfilled and I may die.”
My beloved Sister,
September 2d.
I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am
ever doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that
inhabit it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no
escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave
fellows whom I have persuaded to be my companions look towards
me for aid, but I have none to bestow. There is something terribly
appalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert
me. Yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are
endangered through me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the
cause.
And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not
hear of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return.
Years will pass, and you will have visitings of despair and yet be
tortured by hope. Oh! My beloved sister, the sickening failing of
