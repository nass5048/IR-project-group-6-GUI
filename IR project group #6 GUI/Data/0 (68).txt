“Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community
between you and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our
strength in a fight, in which one must fall.”
“How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a
favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and
compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul
glowed with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably
alone? You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from
your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate
me. The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have
wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I only do not
fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not
grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than
your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind knew of my
existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my
destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep
no terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my
wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and
deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so
great, that not only you and your family, but thousands of others,
shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your
compassion be moved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale;
when you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as you
shall judge that I deserve. But hear me. The guilty are allowed, by
human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own defence
before they are condemned. Listen to me, Frankenstein. You
accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with a satisfied
conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the eternal
justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me, and
then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.”
“Why do you call to my remembrance,” I rejoined,
“circumstances of which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the
miserable origin and author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in
which you first saw light! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the
hands that formed you! You have made me wretched beyond
expression. You have left me no power to consider whether I am
just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from the sight of your
detested form.”
“Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated
hands before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus
I take from thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to
me and grant me thy compassion. By the virtues that I once
possessed, I demand this from you. Hear my tale; it is long and
strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine
sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain. The sun is yet high
in the heavens; before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy
precipices and illuminate another world, you will have heard my
story and can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit for ever the
neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life, or become the
scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own
