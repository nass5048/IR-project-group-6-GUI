return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of
those I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if
any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared
again to blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put
an end to the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued
with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still
desired to delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the
fatigues of a journey, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a
human being. My strength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and
fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame.
Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and
impatience, my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage
on board a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair
wind from the Irish shores. It was midnight. I lay on the deck
looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves. I
hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse
beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see
Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;
yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the
detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told
me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval,
my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and
the monster of my creation. I repassed, in my memory, my whole
life; my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva,
the death of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I
remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on
to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night
in which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought;
a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.
Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom
of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by
means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest
necessary for the preservation of life. Oppressed by the
recollection of my various misfortunes, I now swallowed double
my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did not
afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a
thousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed
by a kind of nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and
could not free myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My
father, who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness,
awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy sky above,
the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce
was established between the present hour and the irresistible,
disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of
which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible.
