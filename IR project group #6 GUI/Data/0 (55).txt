it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed,
she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation
filled the court.
Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had
proceeded, her countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and
misery were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her
tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers
and spoke in an audible although variable voice.
“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I do
not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my
innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which
have been adduced against me, and I hope the character I have
always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation
where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious.”
She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had
passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been
committed at the house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at
about a league from Geneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock,
she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child
who was lost. She was alarmed by this account and passed several
hours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and
she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn
belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants,
to whom she was well known. Most of the night she spent here
watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few
minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke. It was dawn,
and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find
my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was

questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had
passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet
uncertain. Concerning the picture she could give no account.
“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and
fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no
power of explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter
ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities
by which it might have been placed in my pocket. But here also I
am checked. I believe that I have no enemy on earth, and none
surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. Did
the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity afforded him
for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to
part with it again so soon?
“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no
room for hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined
concerning my character, and if their testimony shall not
overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I
would pledge my salvation on my innocence.”
Several witnesses were called who had known her for many
years, and they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime
of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and
