stayed several hours with Justine, and it was with great difficulty
that Elizabeth could tear herself away. “I wish,” cried she, “that I
were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery.”
Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty
repressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a
voice of half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest
Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty,
bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you
will ever suffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.”
And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth’s heart-rending
eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction
in the criminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and
indignant appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their
cold answers and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these
men, my purposed avowal died away on my lips. Thus I might
proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence passed
upon my wretched victim. She perished on the scaffold as a
murderess!
From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the
deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing!
And my father’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling
home all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep,
unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears! Again shall you
raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall
again and again be heard! Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman,
your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop
of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy
except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would
fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you—he
bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if
thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before
the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!
Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and
despair, I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves
of William and Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed
arts.
