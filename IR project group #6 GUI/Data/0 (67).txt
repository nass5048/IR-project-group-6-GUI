tremendous and abhorred!) that it was the wretch whom I had
created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his
approach and then close with him in mortal combat. He
approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined
with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it
almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely observed this;
rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I
recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious
detestation and contempt.
“Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? And do not
you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your
miserable head? Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may
trample you to dust! And, oh! That I could, with the extinction of
your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so
diabolically murdered!”
“I expected this reception,” said the dæmon. “All men hate the
wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all
living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy
creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the
annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you
sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine
towards you and the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my
conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I
will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of
your remaining friends.”
“Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are
too mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach
me with your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the
spark which I so negligently bestowed.”
My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all
the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of
another.
He easily eluded me and said,
“Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your
hatred on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you
seek to increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an
accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.
Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my
height is superior to thine, my joints more supple. But I will not be
tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I
will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou
wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh,
Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me
alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is
most due. Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy
Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy
for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am
irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me
a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”
